# Instagram Visits (Clustering)
This dataset captures Instagram user's visit scores and their spending rank (on a scale of 0 to 100). The goal is to analyze and group users into distinct clusters based on their behaviors, enabling insights into user engagement and spending potential. The dataset is suitable for unsupervised machine learning techniques, which can help identify patterns and group users effectively.

The data was fitted into a Clustering Model that determined the optimal number of clusters as 4 using elbow method. The model predicted a Silhouette score of 0.64 which is good, showing reasonable clustering. PCA was also applied to the data.
